            <h2 class="display-3">Australia</h2>
            <p>Australia's history is a rich and complex tapestry that spans tens of thousands of years. The continent's first
            inhabitants, the Indigenous Australians, have lived on the land for over 65,000 years. These diverse groups developed
            complex societies, languages, and spiritual traditions deeply connected to the land and nature. They practiced
            sustainable living and had intricate knowledge of the flora and fauna.
            
            European exploration began in the early 17th century, with Dutch navigators like Willem Janszoon and Abel Tasman
            charting parts of the coastline. However, it was Captain James Cook's expedition in 1770 that marked the beginning of
            significant European interest. Cook claimed the east coast for Great Britain, naming it New South Wales.
            
            The British established the first penal colony in 1788 at Port Jackson, now Sydney, under the leadership of Captain
            Arthur Phillip. This marked the beginning of significant European settlement, with convicts and free settlers arriving
            in waves. The impact on Indigenous populations was profound and often devastating, resulting in displacement, conflict,
            and cultural disruption.
            
            Throughout the 19th century, Australia experienced significant economic growth and development. The discovery of gold in
            the 1850s sparked a series of gold rushes, attracting prospectors from around the world and leading to rapid population
            growth. Agricultural expansion and the establishment of sheep and cattle stations also played a crucial role in the
            country's economic development.
            
            In 1901, the six British colonies united to form the Commonwealth of Australia, gaining a level of self-governance while
            remaining part of the British Empire. This period saw the development of a national identity, with efforts to define
            what it meant to be Australian.
            
            The 20th century was marked by Australia's participation in both World Wars, which had a significant impact on the
            nation's development. The wars fostered a sense of unity and national pride, but also brought about social change and
            challenges. The post-war period saw Australia embrace immigration, leading to a more multicultural society.
            
            The late 20th and early 21st centuries have been characterized by a focus on reconciliation with Indigenous Australians,
            recognizing their contributions and addressing past injustices. Multiculturalism has become a defining feature of
            Australian society, with people from diverse backgrounds contributing to the nation's cultural richness.
            
            Environmental sustainability has also become a key focus, with efforts to protect Australia's unique landscapes and
            wildlife. Today, Australia is a vibrant and dynamic nation known for its cultural diversity, stunning natural beauty,
            and unique wildlife. The country continues to evolve, building on its complex and storied past while looking towards a
            sustainable and inclusive future.</p>

                            focus primarily on Aboriginal culture, depicted through paintings and sculptures. The
                            vibrant artwork is a joy to admire
                            and the diverse exhibits will continue to provide something new. Entrance to the art gallery
                            is free, but a few special
                            exhibits require an entrance fee.</p>

                            Sydney and the second tallest observation tower in the Southern Hemisphere.
                            At a staggering 309m (1,014ft) tall, the Sydney Tower’s observation deck offers the ultimate
                            360° view of the city.

                            Feeling a bit more adventurous? You can actually walk outside on the skywalk above the
                            observation deck. The Skywalk
                            adventure is filled with amazing views, great photo opportunities, and a couple glass floors
                            to remind you just how high
                            up you truly are.</p>
