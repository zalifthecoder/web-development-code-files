        Utah is home to some truly stunning hills and landscapes. One of the most unique and colorful areas is the Bentonite
        Hills, also known as the Rainbow Mountains. These hills are located just outside of Capitol Reef National Park and are
        famous for their vibrant, Mars-like appearance. The hills are composed of bentonite clay, which gives them their
        distinctive colors and textures.
        
        If you're planning a visit, it's best to go during the blue hour for the most stunning photographs. Just make sure you
        have a high clearance vehicle, as the roads can be challenging.
