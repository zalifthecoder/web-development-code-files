<h1>Gradient</h1>
<p>In mathematics and computer science, a gradient refers to a vector that represents both the direction and rate of the
steepest ascent or descent for a function. In the context of a multivariable function, the gradient is a vector field
pointing in the direction where the function increases most rapidly, with its magnitude indicating the rate of increase.</p>
