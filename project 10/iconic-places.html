            <h2>Johannesburg</h2>
            <p>Johannesburg, often referred to as Jo'burg or Joburg, is the largest city in South Africa and a bustling
                metropolis that
                serves as the economic and cultural heart of the country. This vibrant city is characterized by its rich
                history,
                diverse population, and dynamic urban landscape. Johannesburg is a city of contrasts, where modern
                skyscrapers stand
                alongside historic buildings, and lush green spaces provide a respite from the urban hustle and bustle.

                The city's history is deeply intertwined with the discovery of gold in the late 19th century, which led
                to rapid growth
                and development. Today, Johannesburg is a major financial and commercial hub, home to the Johannesburg
                Stock Exchange
                and numerous multinational corporations. The city also boasts a thriving arts and culture scene, with
                world-class
                museums, galleries, and theaters, such as the Apartheid Museum, the Johannesburg Art Gallery, and the
                Market Theatre.

                Johannesburg is known for its lively neighborhoods, each with its unique character and charm. From the
                trendy cafes and
                boutiques of Melville to the bustling markets of Maboneng Precinct, there's something for everyone to
                explore. The
                city's green spaces, such as the Johannesburg Botanical Garden and Zoo Lake, offer a serene escape from
                the urban
                environment. Additionally, the nearby Cradle of Humankind, a UNESCO World Heritage site, provides
                fascinating insights
                into human evolution and ancient history.</p>
