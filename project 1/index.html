            <h1> What is Front and Back End<h1> 
        <h2>Front-End Development </h2>
        <p>Front-end development focuses on everything the user interacts with directly in their browser. It's all about the look,
        feel, and user experience of a website or app. Think of it as the visible part of the iceberg.
        
        Languages & Tools: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
        
        Frameworks & Libraries: React, Angular, Vue.js
        
        Role: Front-end developers design and implement the website's layout, style, and interactive elements.</p> 
    <h3> Back-End Development</h3>
    <p> Back-end development is like the engine under the hood. It’s where all the complex operations, data storage, and
    business logic happen. This part of the web application remains invisible to the user but is crucial for its
    functionality.
    
    Languages & Tools: Python, Java, Ruby, PHP
    
    Frameworks & Libraries: Express.js(Node.js), Django, Ruby on Rails, Spring
    
    Role: Back-end developers manage the database, server, and application logic. They ensure that the front-end can
    communicate smoothly with the back-end.</p>
    <h3>How They Work Together</h3>
    <p> When you interact with a website, your actions (like clicking a button) trigger events that the front-end captures and
    sends to the back-end. The back-end processes this information and sends a response back to the front-end, which updates
    the user interface accordingly.
    
    In a smple form, front-end is what you see, and back-end is what makes everything work.</p>
    <h4>Advantages of Front End developing</h4>
    <p>Fun Designs: You get to make websites look cool and interesting.</p>
    <p>Job opotunities: Lots of people want to hire you, so you can find good jobs.</p>
    <p>Work From Home: You can do this job from anywhere, even in your  bed!</p>
    <p>Teamwork: You work with other people like designers and tech folks.</p>
    <p>Learning: There's always something new to learn, so it never gets boring.
        <h5>Disadvantages of front end developing</h5>
        <p>Keeping Up: Technology changes fast, so you have to keep learning new things.</p>
        <p>Compatibility: Making sure websites work on all browsers can be a pain.</p>
        <p>Customer Requests: Customers might want a lot of changes and have high expectations.</p>
        <p>Fixing Bugs: Finding and fixing problems on websites can be tricky.</p>
        <p>Skills: You need both design and tech skills, which can be tough to balance.</p>
